Back in 2008, we compiled a DVD called 'Compourri Software Essentials.' It contained all the crucial software for Windows PCs from that era. Fast forward to today, and we've updated the concept for modern Windows 10 and Windows 11 systemsâ€”software essentials galore!

## ðŸ’¡ Usage

Software Essentials must be run in Admin mode because it performs system-wide tweaks. To achieve this, run PowerShell as an administrator. Here are a few ways to do it:

1. **Start menu Method:**
   - Right-click on the start menu.
   - Choose "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" (for Windows 10) or "Terminal (Admin)" (for Windows 11).

2. **Search and Launch Method:**
   - Press the Windows key.
   - Type "PowerShell" or "Terminal" (for Windows 11).
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` or Right-click and choose "Run as administrator" to launch it with administrator privileges.
